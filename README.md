# Random Countries Info App

This is a sample app to demonstrate the concept of building a Rails application by ingesting a third-party API.

## Countries API

The API used by this app can be found at <http://restcountries.eu/#api-endpoints-all>. The specific endpoint that the app consumes from is <https://restcountries.eu/rest/v2/all>. Before digging into the app, try hitting the endpoint (type the endpoint address) intoa browser URL bar. If the resulting JSON feels overwhelming, I recommend using the [JSONView Chrome Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/jsonview/chklaanhfefbnpoihckbnefhakgolnmc?hl=en). All you have to do is add this extension to the Chrome browser and enable it, and your JSON will become that much more manageable.
